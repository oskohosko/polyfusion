# polyfusion
A Web Application that displays 2D convex polygons and can calculate and estimate the intersection between them.
This is my side of the project, the 2D code. This was a University project that I completed in my final year within a group.
There was a 3D side of the project complete using Three.js, a backend and some user auth stuff.

As mentioned, my work is what is contained here, all of the 2D code and design.
A link to the main project repository is [here](https://github.com/jasparm/polyfusion).
